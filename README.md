# Bots
So far this is a very simple IRC bot. It simply joins your channel and that's it. 
My reason for uploading this bot to Github is to help others and share with my friends. 
To run the bot you will need to install a few things.

Lets start
Ubuntu/Debian distros.
1) sudo apt-get update
2) sudo apt-get install nodejs
3) sudo apt-get install npm

Fedora 23 and CentOs
1) curl --silent --location https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | bash -
2) dnf -y install nodejs npm or  yum -y install nodejs npm 
 Windows -
 
 
 
 After you have installed everything we can run the bot.
 node bot.js 
 
 This should run the bot without any problems. 
 As said this is basic code for a bot. As I progress with the bot I will update the current version.
 I hope this will help someone or encourage someone to try bot development.
 
 Any issues? Please inform me.
