# Bots
So far this is a very simple IRC bot. It simply joins your channel and that's it. <br>
My reason for uploading this bot to Github is to help others and share with my friends. <br>
To run the bot you will need to install a few things.<br>

Lets start <br>
Ubuntu/Debian distros.<br>
1) sudo apt-get update<br>
2) sudo apt-get install nodejs<br>
3) sudo apt-get install npm<br>

Fedora 23 and CentOs<br>
1) curl --silent --location https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | bash - <br>
2) dnf -y install nodejs npm or  yum -y install nodejs npm <br>
 
 
 
 After you have installed everything we can run the bot.<br>
 node bot.js <br>
 
 This should run the bot without any problems. <br>
 As said this is basic code for a bot. As I progress with the bot I will update the current version.<br>
 I hope this will help someone or encourage someone to try bot development.<br>
 
 Any issues? Please inform me.<br>
